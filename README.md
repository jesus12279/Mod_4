## Where to get the stock data:

## Project Presentation:

# Project Details:
- For this project i did research on how to get stock information from yahoo finance. When i figured that out i went
- ahead and read sources to understand technical indicators use for stocks to come up with a target for my project.

## Goals:
- My goals for this project is to make a model that can predict when the market hits a Gold Cross or a Death Cross.

## Problems:
 - The main problem i had while building this simple project was not knowing how to calcuate when the
 - moving average's crossed one another.

## Recommendations for further developments:
- Grab the lows and the highs for each time the moving averages crossed over and try different models.
